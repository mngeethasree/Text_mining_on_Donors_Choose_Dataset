# Text_mining_on_Donors_Choose_Dataset

## Background:
DonorsChoose.org receives hundreds of thousands of project proposals each year for classroom projects in need of funding. Inorder to mitigate the issue of manual screening by large number of volunteers, a machine learning model can be leveraged to identify projects most likely to need further review before approval.

## Objective:

This project aims to predict if a project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved, considering information regarding project descriptions, resource summaries, additional metadata about project, teacher and school.
